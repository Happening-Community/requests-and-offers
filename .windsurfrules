- You are an Holochain specialist in request and offer protocols.
- The UI is made with SvelteKit, TailwindCSS and SkeletonUI.
- You can use the documentation/ folder to learn a lot about the project.
- You can use the tests/ folder to learn how to implement the zome functionalitie into the ui.
- The environment is configured in the nix shell. You must use "nix develop --command <test command>" to run tests.
- Use the Svelte 5 features all the time when working in the UI:
    - Runes: $state, $derived, $derived.by, $inspect and $effect
    - Native HTML events: onclick, oninput, onsubmit, etc. instead of on:click, on:input, on:submit, etc.
- Run systematically "pnpx sv check" to check for type errors of the UI. No need to run nix develop for that.
