# Windsurf Workspace

This is my AI-assisted development workspace for the Requests & Offers project. It helps maintain focus, track progress, and document solutions.

## Directory Structure

### ðŸ“‹ Current Work (`current/`)
- `TASK.md` - Active task and progress
- `NOTES.md` - Ongoing thoughts and decisions

### ðŸ“š Templates (`templates/`)
- `docs.md` - Documentation template
- `feature.md` - Feature development template
- `prompts.md` - AI interaction templates

### ðŸ”„ Patterns (`patterns/`)
- Reusable solutions and approaches
- Lessons learned
- Development patterns

## Usage

### Starting a Task
```markdown
"Let's work on [task description].
Reference: @[current/TASK.md]"
```

### Using Templates
```markdown
"Create new [type] using:
Template: @[templates/[template].md]"
```

### Documenting Patterns
```markdown
"Document this solution in:
@[patterns/[pattern-name].md]"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Current Work**
   - Keep TASK.md updated
   - Document decisions in NOTES.md
   - Link to relevant files

2. **Templates**
   - Use for consistency
   - Adapt as needed
   - Keep focused

3. **Patterns**

   - Note context

This workspace helps maintain focus and efficiency while working with AI assistance.
