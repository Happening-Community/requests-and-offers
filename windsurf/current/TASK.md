We have successfully improved the organization management UI and fixed several critical bugs.

However, there are still some issues with the settings section that need to be addressed.

## Priority Bugs
1. ~~**Members and Coordinators Display Issue**~~
   - ✓ Fixed: Members and coordinators are now correctly displayed in separate tables
   - ✓ Implemented proper data loading and display logic
   - ✓ Eliminated redundant display of users

2. ~~**Organization Settings display issue**~~
   - ✓ Fixed: Settings now display correctly for coordinators
   - ✓ Fixed: Form display is working properly
   - [ ] Need to improve URLs field with better validation and UI
   - [ ] Ensure settings persist after updates

3. **Broken UI Controls**
   - [ ] Fix save settings button functionality
   - [ ] Fix delete organization button functionality
   - [ ] Add proper URL validation and formatting
   - [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions

## Next Steps

1. Fix organization settings functionality:
   - [ ] Improve URLs field with a better UI (chip/tag input)
   - [ ] Add URL validation and formatting
   - [ ] Fix save settings functionality
   - [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
   - [ ] Add loading states during save operation

2. Fix delete organization functionality:
   - [ ] Add proper confirmation dialog

   - [ ] Redirect after successful deletion

3. Add comprehensive testing:
   - [ ] Add unit tests for settings update
   - [ ] Add unit tests for organization deletion
   - [ ] Test URL validation and formatting

## Implementation Guidelines
- [x] Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state()`, `$derived()`) for reactivity
- [x] Implement loading states with Skeleton UI components
- [x] Add centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient operations
- [x] Run `bunx sv check` frequently to maintain type safety
- [x] Follow responsive design principles
- [x] Create modular, reusable components

## Development Order
1. [x] Complete UI components for member and coordinator management
2. [x] Create StatusManagementModal for administrator controls
3. [ ] Update organization details page with all required features
4. [x] Integrate administration store for status management
5. [ ] Test and verify all functionality

## Technical Notes
- The organization detail page has been updated with new components and functionality
- State management has been improved but needs further refinement
- UI components have been modernized with better error handling and loading states

## Future Improvements
- Improve performance with pagination and lazy loading
- Add more detailed activity logs
- Implement batch operations for member management
- Add search and filtering capabilities for members and coordinators lists

## Notes
- Status management functionality is already implemented in the administration store (`updateOrganizationStatus`)
- Focus should be on UI components and integration with existing functionality
- Ensure proper permission checks for administrator actions
- Use normal event attributes instead of `on:click` like handlers that are deprecated.
