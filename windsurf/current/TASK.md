## Implementation Guidelines
- [x] Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state()`, `$derived()`) for reactivity

- [x] Add centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient operations
- [x] Run `bunx sv check` frequently to maintain type safety

## Development Order
1. [x] Complete UI components for member and coordinator management

## Notes
- Status management functionality is already implemented in the administration store (`updateOrganizationStatus`)
