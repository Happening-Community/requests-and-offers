## Current Status
We have made significant progress in improving the organization management UI, particularly in displaying and managing members and coordinators. However, there are several critical bugs that need to be addressed.

## Priority Bugs
1. **Members and Coordinators Display Issue**
   - Members and coordinators are not being displayed correctly in the organization details page
   - Need to investigate and fix the data loading and display logic

2. **Organization Settings Persistence**
   - Organization settings disappear when refreshing the organization details page
   - Need to implement proper state persistence and rehydration

3. **Broken UI Controls**
   - Delete organization button is not functioning properly
   - Update status button is broken
   - Need to fix event handlers and state management for these controls

## Implementation Guidelines
- [x] Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state()`, `$derived()`) for reactivity
- [x] Implement loading states with Skeleton UI components
- [x] Add centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient operations
- [x] Run `bunx sv check` frequently to maintain type safety
- [x] Follow responsive design principles
- [x] Create modular, reusable components

## Development Order
1. [x] Complete UI components for member and coordinator management
2. [x] Create StatusManagementModal for administrator controls
3. [ ] Update organization details page with all required features
4. [x] Integrate administration store for status management
5. [ ] Test and verify all functionality

## Next Steps
1. Debug and fix the members and coordinators display issue
   - Verify data loading in `loadOrganization()`
   - Check state management for members and coordinators lists
   - Ensure proper rendering of user information

2. Implement proper state persistence
   - Add state persistence for organization settings
   - Implement proper state rehydration on page refresh

3. Fix broken UI controls
   - Debug and fix delete organization functionality
   - Repair update status button handlers
   - Add proper error handling and user feedback

4. Add comprehensive testing
   - Add unit tests for critical functionality
   - Implement integration tests for user flows
   - Add error boundary testing

## Technical Notes
- The organization detail page has been updated with new components and functionality
- State management has been improved but needs further refinement
- UI components have been modernized with better error handling and loading states

## Future Improvements
- Add search and filtering capabilities for members and coordinators lists
- Implement batch operations for member management
- Add more detailed activity logs
- Improve performance with pagination and lazy loading

## Notes
- Status management functionality is already implemented in the administration store (`updateOrganizationStatus`)
- Focus should be on UI components and integration with existing functionality
- Ensure proper permission checks for administrator actions
