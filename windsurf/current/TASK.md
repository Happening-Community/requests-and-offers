## Refactoring Patterns and Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient data fetching
- Implement explicit error handling
- Optimize reactive state management
- Add comprehensive error messaging
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Create reusable components for common UI patterns
- Use systematicly "bunx sv check" from ui/ to report errors and warnings
  - Run in ui/ after significant changes
  - Fix type errors immediately
  - Address all warnings to maintain code quality

### State Management
- Implement consistent loading states
- Add error state and messaging
- Use derived stores for computed values
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Error Handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Log errors for debugging
- Gracefully handle network and data fetching issues

## Development Best Practices

### Type Safety
- Run `pnpx sv check` frequently to catch type issues early
- Fix type errors as soon as they appear to maintain code quality
- Use proper TypeScript types for all components and stores

### Layout and Styling
- Use grid layouts for consistent spacing
- Maintain proper component hierarchy
- Follow responsive design principles
- Keep styles modular and reusable

## Development Workflow and Documentation

### Task Tracking Best Practices
- **Continuous Documentation**
  - Update `TASK.md` after each significant code change or feature implementation
  - Use checkboxes to track progress of tasks and subtasks
  - Add detailed notes about implementation challenges and solutions
  - Include timestamps or git commit references for major changes
  - Maintain a clear, chronological log of development progress

### Tracking Workflow
1. **Immediate Update Triggers**
   - After completing a feature or component
   - When resolving a bug
   - After refactoring code
   - When adding new dependencies or significant architectural changes

2. **Documentation Checklist**
   - [ ] Update completed tasks with checkmarks
   - [ ] Add notes about implementation details
   - [ ] Log any discovered issues or technical debt
   - [ ] Reflect current project status accurately
   - [ ] Ensure all sections remain up-to-date

3. **Commit and Version Control**
   - Commit `TASK.md` updates along with related code changes
   - Use descriptive commit messages explaining documentation updates
   - Consider `TASK.md` as a living document that evolves with the project

### Recommended Update Frequency
- **Minimum**: After each coding session
- **Ideal**: Immediately after completing a task or making a significant change
- **Critical**: Always update before switching between different project areas or tasks

## Next Focus Areas

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete Admin Routes Refactoring
   - [x] Organizations Management Page
   - [x] Administrators Management Page

2. Shared Components Refinement
   - [ ] Modals
     - User Details (`/lib/modals/UserDetailsModal.svelte`)
     - Organization Details (`/lib/modals/OrganizationDetailsModal.svelte`)
     - ~~Administrator Details Modal (New)~~ *Not needed - using existing UserDetailsModal*
   - [ ] Tables
     - Users Table (`/lib/tables/UsersTable.svelte`)
     - Status Table (`/lib/tables/StatusTable.svelte`)
   - [x] Navigation Components
     - NavBar (`/lib/NavBar.svelte`)
     - MenuDrawer (`/lib/drawers/MenuDrawer.svelte`)
     - AdminMenuDrawer (`/lib/drawers/AdminMenuDrawer.svelte`)
     - ActionBar (`/lib/ActionBar.svelte`)

### Long-term Improvements
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Document refactoring patterns
- Review and optimize performance
- Enhance type safety across components

## Success Criteria
- [x] Clear user feedback mechanisms across all components
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for all routes
- [x] Consistent reactive state management
- [x] Improved code modularity and reusability
- [x] Enhanced user experience with informative loading and error states

## Action Items
- Review remaining unrefactored components
- Apply consistent refactoring techniques
- Continue monitoring and fixing type issues
- Maintain layout consistency across new components
