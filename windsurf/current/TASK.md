  - [x] Centered page title
  - [x] Removed mocked data and complex loading logic
- [ ] Organizations
  - [x] List (`/routes/(app)/organizations/+page.svelte`)

### 2. Admin Routes
- [ ] Dashboard (`/routes/admin/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Users (`/routes/admin/users/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Requests (`/routes/admin/requests/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Offers (`/routes/admin/offers/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Projects (`/routes/admin/projects/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Organizations (`/routes/admin/organizations/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Administrators (`/routes/admin/administrators/+page.svelte`)

### 3. Shared Components
#### Modals
- [ ] User Details (`/lib/modals/UserDetailsModal.svelte`)
- [ ] Organization Details (`/lib/modals/OrganizationDetailsModal.svelte`)
- [ ] Add Administrator (`/lib/modals/AddAdministratorModal.svelte`)
- [ ] Status History (`/lib/modals/StatusHistoryModal.svelte`)

#### Tables
- [ ] Organizations Table (`/lib/tables/OrganizationsTable.svelte`)
- [ ] Users Table (`/lib/tables/UsersTable.svelte`)
- [ ] Status Table (`/lib/tables/StatusTable.svelte`)

#### Navigation
- [ ] NavBar (`/lib/NavBar.svelte`)

- [ ] AdminMenuDrawer (`/lib/drawers/AdminMenuDrawer.svelte`)
- [ ] ActionBar (`/lib/ActionBar.svelte`)

## Refactoring Patterns
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient data fetching
- Implement explicit error handling
- Optimize reactive state management
- Add comprehensive error messaging
- Remove unnecessary comments

## Next Components to Review
1. Admin Dashboard
2. Request/Offer Pages
3. Project Management Pages
4. Admin Routes
   - Users Management
   - Requests Management
   - Offers Management
   - Projects Management
   - Organizations Management
   - Administrators Management

## Action Items
- [x] Review User Management components
- [x] Review Organizations components
- [ ] Review remaining unrefactored components
- [ ] Apply similar refactoring techniques
- [ ] Document refactoring patterns
- [ ] Update testing strategy
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive code review

## Success Criteria
- [x] Improved error resilience in User Management
- [x] Consistent code quality in User and Organizations pages
- [x] Optimized data fetching for User and Organizations components
- [ ] Clear user feedback mechanisms across all components
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all routes
- [ ] Consistent reactive state management

## Next Steps
1. Select next component for refactoring
2. Apply learned refactoring techniques
3. Document findings
4. Conduct thorough testing
