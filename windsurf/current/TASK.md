## Implementation Guidelines
- [x] Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state()`, `$derived()`) for reactivity
- [x] Implement loading states with Skeleton UI components
- [x] Add centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient operations
- [x] Run `bunx sv check` frequently to maintain type safety
- [x] Follow responsive design principles
- [x] Create modular, reusable components

## Development Order
1. [ ] Complete UI components for member and coordinator management
2. [ ] Create StatusManagementModal for administrator controls
3. [ ] Update organization details page with all required features
4. [ ] Integrate administration store for status management
5. [ ] Test and verify all functionality

## Notes
- Status management functionality is already implemented in the administration store (`updateOrganizationStatus`)
- Focus should be on UI components and integration with existing functionality
- Ensure proper permission checks for administrator actions
