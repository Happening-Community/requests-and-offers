## Components to Review
### 1. Main Routes (App)
- [x] Home (`/routes/(app)/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Requests (`/routes/(app)/requests/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Offers (`/routes/(app)/offers/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Projects (`/routes/(app)/projects/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Organizations
  - [x] List (`/routes/(app)/organizations/+page.svelte`)
  - [x] Create (`/routes/(app)/organizations/create/+page.svelte`)
- [x] User Management
  - [x] Profile (`/routes/(app)/user/+page.svelte`)
  - [x] Create (`/routes/(app)/user/create/+page.svelte`)
  - [x] Edit (`/routes/(app)/user/edit/+page.svelte`)

### 2. Admin Routes
- [ ] Dashboard (`/routes/admin/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Users (`/routes/admin/users/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Requests (`/routes/admin/requests/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Offers (`/routes/admin/offers/+page.svelte`)

- [ ] Organizations (`/routes/admin/organizations/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Administrators (`/routes/admin/administrators/+page.svelte`)

### 3. Shared Components
#### Modals
- [ ] User Details (`/lib/modals/UserDetailsModal.svelte`)
- [ ] Organization Details (`/lib/modals/OrganizationDetailsModal.svelte`)
- [ ] Add Administrator (`/lib/modals/AddAdministratorModal.svelte`)
- [ ] Status History (`/lib/modals/StatusHistoryModal.svelte`)

#### Tables
- [x] Organizations Table (`/lib/tables/OrganizationsTable.svelte`)
- [ ] Users Table (`/lib/tables/UsersTable.svelte`)
- [ ] Status Table (`/lib/tables/StatusTable.svelte`)

#### Navigation
- [ ] NavBar (`/lib/NavBar.svelte`)

- [ ] AdminMenuDrawer (`/lib/drawers/AdminMenuDrawer.svelte`)
- [ ] ActionBar (`/lib/ActionBar.svelte`)

## Refactoring Patterns
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient data fetching
- Implement explicit error handling
- Optimize reactive state management
- Add comprehensive error messaging
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Create reusable components for common UI patterns
