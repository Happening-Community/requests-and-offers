# Current Task: UI Refactoring and Store Integration Review

## Refactoring Progress

### 1. Main Routes (App)
- [x] Home (`/routes/(app)/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Requests (`/routes/(app)/requests/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Offers (`/routes/(app)/offers/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Projects (`/routes/(app)/projects/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Organizations
  - [x] List (`/routes/(app)/organizations/+page.svelte`)
  - [x] Create (`/routes/(app)/organizations/create/+page.svelte`)
- [x] User Management
  - [x] Profile (`/routes/(app)/user/+page.svelte`)
    - Fixed status type checking
    - Improved error handling
    - Added proper null checks
  - [x] Create (`/routes/(app)/user/create/+page.svelte`)
  - [x] Edit (`/routes/(app)/user/edit/+page.svelte`)

### 2. Admin Routes
- [x] Dashboard (`/routes/admin/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Requests (`/routes/admin/requests/+page.svelte`)
  - Created minimal placeholder implementation
  - Added basic loading and error states
  - Prepared for future implementation
- [x] Offers (`/routes/admin/offers/+page.svelte`)
  - Created minimal placeholder implementation
  - Added basic loading and error states
  - Prepared for future implementation
- [x] Users Management (`/routes/admin/users/+page.svelte`)
  - Refactored with derived stores for user categories
  - Added retry functionality for failed loads
  - Improved error handling with toast notifications
  - Enhanced UI with better organization of user lists
- [ ] Projects Management (`/routes/admin/projects/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Organizations Management (`/routes/admin/organizations/+page.svelte`)
- [ ] Administrators Management (`/routes/admin/administrators/+page.svelte`)

### 3. Layout Improvements
- [x] App Layout
  - Fixed grid layout for proper content centering
  - Removed unnecessary padding and margins
  - Improved navbar positioning
- [x] Admin Layout
  - Adjusted sidebar spacing and padding
  - Fixed content area layout
  - Improved responsive behavior

## Refactoring Patterns and Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient data fetching
- Implement explicit error handling
- Optimize reactive state management
- Add comprehensive error messaging
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Create reusable components for common UI patterns

### State Management
- Implement consistent loading states
- Add error state and messaging
- Use derived stores for computed values
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Error Handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Log errors for debugging
- Gracefully handle network and data fetching issues

## Development Best Practices

### Type Safety
- Run `pnpx sv check` frequently to catch type issues early
- Fix type errors as soon as they appear to maintain code quality
- Use proper TypeScript types for all components and stores

### Layout and Styling
- Use grid layouts for consistent spacing
- Maintain proper component hierarchy
- Follow responsive design principles
- Keep styles modular and reusable

## Next Focus Areas

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete Admin Routes Refactoring
   - [ ] Projects Management Page
   - [ ] Organizations Management Page
   - [ ] Administrators Management Page

2. Shared Components Refinement
   - [ ] Modals
     - User Details (`/lib/modals/UserDetailsModal.svelte`)
     - Organization Details (`/lib/modals/OrganizationDetailsModal.svelte`)
     - Add Administrator (`/lib/modals/AddAdministratorModal.svelte`)
     - Status History (`/lib/modals/StatusHistoryModal.svelte`)
   - [ ] Tables
     - Users Table (`/lib/tables/UsersTable.svelte`)
     - Status Table (`/lib/tables/StatusTable.svelte`)
   - [x] Navigation Components
     - NavBar (`/lib/NavBar.svelte`)
     - MenuDrawer (`/lib/drawers/MenuDrawer.svelte`)
     - AdminMenuDrawer (`/lib/drawers/AdminMenuDrawer.svelte`)
     - ActionBar (`/lib/ActionBar.svelte`)

### Long-term Improvements
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Document refactoring patterns
- Review and optimize performance
- Enhance type safety across components

## Success Criteria
- [x] Clear user feedback mechanisms across all components
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for all routes
- [x] Consistent reactive state management
- [x] Improved code modularity and reusability
- [x] Enhanced user experience with informative loading and error states

## Action Items
- Review remaining unrefactored components
- Apply consistent refactoring techniques
- Continue monitoring and fixing type issues
- Maintain layout consistency across new components
