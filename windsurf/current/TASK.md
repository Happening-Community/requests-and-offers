## Refactoring Patterns and Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for resilient data fetching
- Implement explicit error handling
- Optimize reactive state management
- Add comprehensive error messaging
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Create reusable components for common UI patterns

### State Management
- Implement consistent loading states
- Add error state and messaging
- Use derived stores for computed values
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Error Handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Log errors for debugging
- Gracefully handle network and data fetching issues

### Svelte 5 Standards
- **Maintain Svelte 5 Best Practices**
  * Continue using Svelte 5 runes (`$state()`, `$derived()`, `$props()`)
  * Follow Svelte 5 component structure and patterns
  * Ensure new components adhere to Svelte 5 standards
  * Keep codebase consistent with modern Svelte practices

### Consistency Strategies
- **Existing Work as Reference**
  * Use recently refactored components and pages as templates
  * Extract and document common refactoring approaches
  * Create a consistent component structure template

## Development Best Practices

### Type Safety
- Run `pnpx sv check` frequently to catch type issues early
- Fix type errors as soon as they appear to maintain code quality
- Use proper TypeScript types for all components and stores

### Layout and Styling
- Use grid layouts for consistent spacing
- Maintain proper component hierarchy
- Follow responsive design principles
- Keep styles modular and reusable

### Component Design
- **Standardization Techniques**
  * Implement optional props with default values
  * Use conditional rendering for optional elements
  * Create consistent empty state handling
  * Maintain uniform styling and layout approaches

### Code Quality
- **Consistency Checklist**
  * Use Svelte 5 runes consistently
  * Implement clear, descriptive prop types
  * Add meaningful comments for complex logic
  * Ensure components are small, focused, and reusable
  * Follow a uniform error and loading state management strategy
- Use systematicly "bunx sv check" from ui/ to report errors and warnings
  * Run in ui/ after significant changes
  * Fix type errors immediately
  * Address all warnings to maintain code quality

## Development Workflow and Documentation

### Task Tracking Best Practices
- **Continuous Documentation**
  - Update `TASK.md` after each significant code change or feature implementation
  - Use checkboxes to track progress of tasks and subtasks
  - Add detailed notes about implementation challenges and solutions
  - Include timestamps or git commit references for major changes
  - Maintain a clear, chronological log of development progress

### Tracking Workflow
1. **Immediate Update Triggers**
   - After completing a feature or component
   - When resolving a bug
   - After refactoring code
   - When adding new dependencies or significant architectural changes

2. **Documentation Checklist**
   - [ ] Update completed tasks with checkmarks
   - [ ] Add notes about implementation details
   - [ ] Log any discovered issues or technical debt
   - [ ] Reflect current project status accurately
   - [ ] Ensure all sections remain up-to-date

3. **Commit and Version Control**
   - Commit `TASK.md` updates along with related code changes
   - Use descriptive commit messages explaining documentation updates
   - Consider `TASK.md` as a living document that evolves with the project

### Recommended Update Frequency
- **Minimum**: After each coding session
- **Ideal**: Immediately after completing a task or making a significant change
- **Critical**: Always update before switching between different project areas or tasks

## Next Steps

### 1. Modals Refinement
- [x] Review and standardize `UserDetailsModal.svelte`
  * Improved layout and styling with consistent spacing
  * Added card-based sections for better organization
  * Enhanced status display with dynamic chip styling
  * Improved typography and visual hierarchy
- [x] Review and standardize `OrganizationDetailsModal.svelte`
  * Matched styling patterns from UserDetailsModal
  * Implemented centered layout for better presentation
  * Added consistent card sections for information display
  * Enhanced status chip styling with dynamic states
  * Improved links and email display with hover effects

### 2. Type Definitions and Interfaces
- Audit and consolidate type definitions in `@/types/ui.ts`
  * Review existing interfaces for `UIUser`, `UIOrganization`
  * Remove redundant or unused type definitions
  * Add comprehensive type annotations
- Create a centralized type management strategy
  * Consider using type inheritance
  * Implement strict type checking
  * Add comprehensive type documentation
- Ensure type consistency across all components
  * Validate prop types in all table and modal components
  * Add runtime type checking where necessary

## Success Criteria
- [x] Clear user feedback mechanisms across all components
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for all routes
- [x] Consistent reactive state management
- [x] Improved code modularity and reusability
- [x] Enhanced user experience with informative loading and error states

## Action Items
- Review remaining unrefactored components
- Apply consistent refactoring techniques
- Continue monitoring and fixing type issues
- Maintain layout consistency across new components
