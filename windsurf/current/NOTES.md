# Project Notes - UI Refactoring and Store Integration

## Current Status
- Active Task: UI Refactoring and Store Integration Review
- Focus: Systematic Component Refactoring
- Priority: High

## Recent Work
### User Profile Page Refactoring
- Implemented advanced error handling
- Optimized data fetching with `Promise.allSettled()`
- Improved reactive state management
- Added explicit error state and messaging

### Organizations Page Refactoring
- Comprehensive error handling implementation
- Resilient data fetching strategy
- Added retry mechanism
- Improved user experience with error states

## Lessons Learned
1. Promise Handling
   - `Promise.allSettled()` provides more resilient data fetching
   - Allows partial success in data retrieval
   - Better error management

2. Reactive State Management
   - Use `$derived.by()` for memoization
   - Explicit error states improve user experience
   - Separate data fetching logic for clarity

## Next Focus Areas
### Priority Components
1. Admin Dashboard
2. User Creation/Edit Pages
3. Request/Offer Pages

## Refactoring Strategy
- Consistent error handling
- Optimize data fetching
- Improve state management
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Enhance user feedback mechanisms

## Investigation Points
1. Performance impact of new fetching strategies
2. Consistency in error handling across components
3. Backward compatibility considerations

## Tracking
- Refactored Components: 
  - User Profile Page
  - Organizations Page
- Pending Components: 
  - Admin Dashboard
  - User Creation/Edit Pages
  - Request/Offer Pages

## Tools and Approaches
- Svelte DevTools
- Performance Profiling
- Comprehensive Error Logging
- Systematic Refactoring Approach

## Notes
- Maintain clean, readable code
- Focus on user experience
- Document refactoring patterns
- Continuous improvement
