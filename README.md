## Environment Setup

> PREREQUISITE: set up the [holochain development environment](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/).

Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

```bash
nix develop
pnpm install
```

**Run all the other instructions in this README from inside this nix develop, otherwise they won't work**.

## Running 2 agents
 
```bash
pnpm start
```

This will create a network of 2 nodes connected to their UI.
It will also bring up the Holochain Playground for advanced introspection of the conductors.

## Running another number of agents

```bash
AGENTS=1 pnpm start
```

It is possible to create a network with a different number of nodes by changing the AGENTS variable.
