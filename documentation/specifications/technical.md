# Technical Specifications

## 1. Infrastructure

### 1.1 Holo Hosting

- **Holo Hosting Overview**: Leverages HoloHosts for robust and scalable infrastructure, contributing to the network's infrastructure and enhancing performance and reliability.
- **Hosting Requirements**: Requires a distributed network of HoloHosts for high availability and redundancy. The Holo Network can supply multiple HoloHosts for redundancy.
- **Hosting Benefits**: Fosters a decentralized and resilient infrastructure, aligning with Holochain ecosystem principles.

## 2. Technologies

### 2.1 Core Technologies

- **Holochain**: Core technology for building the application, ensuring local-first and peer-to-peer network capabilities.
- **SvelteKit**: Utilized for the guest/front-end, providing a modern and efficient framework for web development.
  - **Skeleton UI**: A component library for building user interfaces with SvelteKit and Tailwind. 
- **hREA**: hREA (Holochain Resource-Event-Agent) is an implementation of the Valueflows specification. It enables a transparent and trusted account of resource and information flows between decentralized and independent agents, across and within ecosystems.

### 4.5 Architecture Principles

1. **Decentralization**: The system leverages Holochain's peer-to-peer architecture to ensure:
   - Data sovereignty
   - Resilient infrastructure
   - No single point of failure

2. **Modularity**: The system is built with clear separation of concerns:
   - Frontend (SvelteKit + Skeleton UI)
   - Backend DNA (Holochain Zomes)
   - Messaging DNA
   - Data storage (DHT)

3. **Security**: Built-in security features:
   - User authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Data validation
   - Secure messaging

4. **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale through:
   - Distributed hosting
   - Efficient data structures
   - Modular components
