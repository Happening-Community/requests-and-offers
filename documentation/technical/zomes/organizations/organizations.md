# Organizations Zome Specification

## Overview

The Organizations Zome manages organization profiles and their relationships with users within the system. It consists of two parts:
1. Integrity Zome: Defines entry and link types, validation rules
2. Coordinator Zome: Implements business logic and external functions

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Entry Types

#### Organization Entry
```rust
#[hdk_entry_helper]
pub struct Organization {
    /// Name of the organization
    pub name: String,
    
    /// Organization's description
    pub description: String,
    
    /// Optional organization logo (serialized)
    pub logo: Option<SerializedBytes>,
    
    /// Contact email
    pub email: String,
    
    /// Related URLs (website, social media, etc.)
    pub urls: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Organization's location
    pub location: String,
}
```

### 2. Link Types

```rust
pub enum LinkTypes {
    AllOrganizations,          // Global organization index
    OrganizationStatus,        // Links organization to status
    UserOrganizations,         // Links users to organizations
    OrganizationMembers,       // Links organizations to members
    OrganizationCoordinators,  // Links organizations to coordinators
    OrganizationUpdates,       // Links organization updates
}
```
