# Requests & Offers - MVP Specification Document

## 1. Introduction

The Requests & Offers - MVP project aims to develop a Holochain application designed to facilitate the exchange of requests and offers within the hAppenings.community. This document outlines the specifications and requirements for the development of this application, focusing on its core functionalities, technologies, and user interactions.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a simple, open-source Holochain application that enables Creators, Projects, and Developers to reach out to Holochain Advocates with specific requests for support. The application will be built on Holochain, incorporating TimeBanking and Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) design ideas and potentially including a Mutual Credit Currency component in post MVP versions.

## 3. Targeted Audience

This application is specifically tailored for the participants in the Holochain Ecosystem. At hAppenings.community, we have created our own definitions of the individuals who would be participants in Requests & Offers - MVP. The targeted audience includes:

- **Holochain Creators/Projects/Developers**: Individuals or groups actively involved in creating or developing projects within the Holochain ecosystem.
- **Holochain Advocates**: Individuals passionate about the Holochain technology, looking to support projects within the ecosystem.

Additionally, the application is supported by:
- **HoloHosts**: External ecosystem agents who support the community by providing Holo hosting infrastructure for the happ. While not direct users of the application, they play a crucial role in making the application accessible to end-users through the Holo network.

- **Project Creation by Verified Organizations**: Projects within the network can be directly created by verified organizations. This streamlines the project initiation process for organizations that have already been vetted by the network administrators.
- **Verification of Projects Not Managed by Verified Organizations**: In cases where a user wishes to create a project that is not managed by a verified organization, the project must undergo a verification process by the network administrators. This ensures that all projects, regardless of their management structure, meet the network's standards and objectives.

Key aspects of administrator and moderator roles and access include:

- **Exclusive Access to Administration Zome and UI**: Administrators and moderators are granted special access to the `Administration` zome and user interface, enabling them to effectively carry out their duties, including the verification of users, organizations, and projects.
